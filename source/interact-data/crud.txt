Overview
--------

CRUD operations create, read, update, and delete documents. In this guide, you 
can learn how to use {+odm+} to perform CRUD operations.

Create Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create operations add new documents to a collection. If the collection doesn't
currently exist, the operation creates a new collection. The following section
describes the methods you can use to create new documents.

``Model.create!``
+++++++++++++++++

Use ``Model.create!`` to insert a new document or multiple new documents into
the database. If a server or validation error occurs, ``Model.create!`` raises
an exception.

To call ``Model.create!``, pass a hash of attributes to create a document with
the specified attributes. If you want to create and insert multiple documents, 
you can pass an array of hashes.

The following code shows three ways to call ``Model.create!``. The first example
creates one ``Person`` document, and the second example creates two ``Person``
documents. The third example passes a ``do..end`` block to ``create!``. {+odm+}
invokes this block with the documents passed to ``create!`` as arguments. ``Model.create!``
attempts to save the document at the end of the block.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start create! example
   :end-before: end create! example

``Model.create``
++++++++++++++++

Use ``Model.create`` to insert a new document or multiple new documents into a 
database. ``Model.create`` is similar to ``Model.create!`` but
does not raise an exception on validation errors. Like ``Model.create!``, 
``Model.create`` still raises exceptions on server errors, such as when
inserting a document with an ``_id`` that already exists in the collection. 

If ``Model.create`` encounters any validation errors, the document is not inserted
but is returned with other documents that were inserted. You can use the
``persisted?``, ``new_record?`` or ``errors`` methods to check which of the
returned documents were inserted into the database.

The following code shows how to use ``Model.create``. The first example shows
how to insert a ``Person`` document like in the preceding ``Model.create!``
example. The second example attempts to insert two ``Post`` documents, one of which
fails validation. The example then uses the ``persisted?`` method to check which
of the documents was not inserted into the collection.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start create example
   :end-before: end create example

For more information on the ``persisted`` and ``new_record`` methods, see
the :ref:`mongoid-persistence-attr` section.

``Model#save!``
+++++++++++++++

Use ``Model#save!`` to atomically save changed attributes to the collection or
to insert a new document. ``Model#save!`` raises an exception if there are any
server or validation errors. You can use ``Model.new`` to create a new document
instance. Then, use ``Model#save!`` to insert the document into the database.

The following example shows how to use ``Model#save!`` to insert a new ``Person``
document and to update the ``first_name`` attribute of an existing document.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start save! example
   :end-before: end save! example

``Model#save``
++++++++++++++

``Model#save`` is similar to ``Model#save!``, except ``Model#save`` does not
raise an exception if there are any validation errors. ``Model#save`` still raises
an exception if there are any server errors. The method returns ``true`` if
all changed attributes were saved, and ``false`` if there were any validation
errors.

You can pass the following options to ``Model#save``:

- ``validate: false``: bypass validations when saving the new document or updated
  attributes.

- ``touch: false``: ignore updates to the ``updated_at`` field when updating
  attributes. This option has no effect when inserting a new document.

The following code uses ``Model#save`` to insert a new document. It then updates
that document while using the ``validate: false`` option.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start save example
   :end-before: end save example

Read Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read operations retrieve documents from a collection.

``Model#attributes``
++++++++++++++++++++

You can use ``Model#attributes`` to get the attributes of a model instance.
``Model#attributes`` returns the attributes as a hash. This hash also contains 
the attributes of all embedded documents.

The following example shows how to use ``Model#attributes`` to get the attributes
of an existing model instance:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
      :language: ruby
      :start-after: start attributes example
      :end-before: end attributes example
    
   .. output::
      :language: json
      
      { "_id" => BSON::ObjectId('633467d03282a43784c2d56e'), 
        "first_name" => "James", 
        "last_name" => "Nan" 
      }

.. TODO: getting/setting attributes here?

Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update operations modify existing documents in a collection.

Attempting to update a deleted document results in a ``FrozenError`` exception.

``Model#update_attributes!``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can use ``Model#update_attributes!`` to update the attributes of an
existing model instance. This method raises an exception if it encounters
a validation or server error.

The following example shows how to use ``Model#update_attributes!`` to update
the ``first_name`` and ``last_name`` attributes of an existing document:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start update attributes! example
   :end-before: end update attributes! example

``Model#update_attributes``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``Model#update_attributes`` is similar to ``Model#update_attributes!`` except it
does not raise an exception on validation errors. The method will return ``true``
if it passes validation and the document is updated, and ``false`` otherwise.

The following example shows how to use ``Model#update_attributes``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start update attributes example
   :end-before: end update attributes example

``Model#update_attribute``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can use ``Model#update_attribute`` to bypass validations and update a single 
attribute of a model instance.

The following example shows how to use ``Model#update_attribute`` to update
a document's ``first_name`` attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start update attribute example
   :end-before: end update attribute example

``Model#upsert``
++++++++++++++++

You can use ``Model#upsert`` to update, insert, or replace a document.

``Model#upsert`` accepts a ``replace`` option. If this option is set to ``true``
and the document that calls ``Model#upsert`` exists in the database, the new document
replaces the one in the database. Any fields in the database
that the new document does not specify are removed.

If the ``replace`` option is set to ``false`` and the document exists in the 
database, it is updated. It persists any fields in the database that the new 
document does not specify. If the document does not exist in the
database, it is inserted. The ``replace`` option is set to ``false`` by default.

The following example shows how to use ``Model#upsert`` to first insert a new document
then replace it:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start upsert example
   :end-before: end upsert example

.. TODO understand this example

``Model#touch``
+++++++++++++++

You can use ``Model#touch`` to update a document's ``updated_at`` timestamp with
the current time. ``Model#touch`` cascades the update to all the document's 
``belongs_to`` associations. You can also pass another time field as an option
to update this field.

The following example uses ``Model#touch`` to update the 
``updated_at`` and ``audited_at`` timestamps:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start touch example
   :end-before: end touch example

.. TODO: are both timestamps updated in one call?

Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete operations remove documents from a collection.

``Model#delete``
++++++++++++++++

You can use ``Model#delete`` to delete a document from the database. When you
use ``Model#delete``, {+odm+} does not run callbacks. If the document is not
saved to the database, ``Model#delete`` attempts to delete any document with the same ``_id``.

The following example shows how to delete a document using ``Model#delete``, as
well as what happens when you delete a document that is not saved to the database.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start delete example
   :end-before: end delete example

In the preceding example, {+odm+} raises a ``Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound``
error because the ``person`` document was deleted when ``unsaved_person.delete``
was called since the two documents had the same value for ``_id``.

``Model#destroy``
+++++++++++++++++

``Model#destroy`` is similar to ``Model#delete`` except {+odm+} runs callbacks
when it calls ``Model#destroy``. If the document is not found in the database,
``Model#destroy`` also attempts to delete any document with the same ``_id``.

The following example shows how to use ``Model#destroy``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start destroy example
   :end-before: end destroy example

``Model.delete_all``
++++++++++++++++++++

``Model.delete_all`` deletes all documents from the collection that ``Model`` 
represents. ``Model.delete_all`` does not run callbacks.

The following example shows how to use ``Model.delete_all``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start delete all example
   :end-before: end delete all example

``Model.destroy_all``
+++++++++++++++++++++

``Model.destroy_all`` deletes all documents from the collection that ``Model`` 
represents. ``Model.destroy_all`` runs callbacks. This can be an expensive operation
because all documents are loaded into memory.

The following example shows how to use ``Model.destroy_all``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start destroy all example
   :end-before: end destroy all example

.. _mongoid-persistence-attr:

Persistence Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} provides the following attributes to check if a document is
persisted to the database.

``Model#new_record?``
+++++++++++++++++++++

``Model#new_record?`` returns ``true`` if the model instance has not been 
saved to the database yet, and ``false`` otherwise. It is the opposite of
``Model#persisted?``.

The following example shows how to use ``Model#new_record?``:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
      :language: ruby
      :start-after: start new record example
      :end-before: end new record example

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      true

      false

``Model#persisted?``
++++++++++++++++++++

``Model#persisted?`` returns ``true`` if the model instance is persisted to the
database, and ``false`` otherwise. ``Model#persisted?`` is the opposite of
``Model#new_record?``.

The following example shows how to use ``Model#persisted?``:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
      :language: ruby
      :start-after: start persisted example
      :end-before: end persisted example

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      false

      true

Atomic Update Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} provides support for the following update operators. You can call these
operators as methods on {+odm+} documents. These methods perform operations 
atomically. They skip validations and callbacks.

{+odm+} supports the following operators:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 60

   * - Operator
     - Example

   * - ``Model#add_to_set``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.add_to_set(aliases: "Bond")

   * - ``Model#bit``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.bit(age: { and: 10, or: 12 })

   * - ``Model#inc``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.inc(age: 1)

   * - ``Model#pop``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.pop(aliases: 1)

   * - ``Model#pull``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.pull(aliases: "Bond")

   * - ``Model#pull_all``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.pull_all(aliases: [ "Bond", "James" ])

   * - ``Model#push``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.push(aliases: ["007","008"])

   * - ``Model#rename``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.rename(bday: :dob)

   * - ``Model#set``

       Updates an attribute on the model instance and, if the instance
       is already persisted, performs an atomic ``$set`` on the field, bypassing
       validations.

       ``set`` can also deeply set values on Hash fields.

       ``set`` can also deeply set values on ``embeds_one`` associations.
       If a model instance's ``embeds_one`` association document is ``nil``, one
       is created prior to the update.

       ``set`` should not be used with ``has_one`` associations.

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person = Person.create!(name: "Ricky Bobby")
          person.set(name: "Tyler Durden") # updates name in the database

    	  person = Person.new
          person.set(name: "Tyler Durden") # does not write to database
    	  person.name # => "Tyler Durden"
    	  person.persisted? # => true

    	  class Post
    	    include Mongoid::Document

    	    field :metadata, type: Hash
    	  end

          post = Post.create!
          post.set('metadata.published_at' => Time.now)
          post.metadata['published_at'] # => Time instance

          post.set('metadata.approved.today' => true)
          post.metadata['approved'] # => {'today' => true}

          class Flight
            include Mongoid::Document

            embeds_one :plan
          end

          class Plan
            include Mongoid::Document

            embedded_in :flight

            field :route, type: String
          end

          flight = Flight.create!
          flight.plan # => nil
          flight.set('plan.route', 'test route')
          flight.plan # => Plan instance
          flight.plan.route # => "test route"

   * - ``Model#unset``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.unset(:name)

To learn more about update operators, see the :manual:`Update Operators <reference/operator/update>` 
guide in the MongoDB {+server-manual+}.

Group Atomic Operations
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To group atomic operations together, you can use the ``#atomically`` method 
on a document. All operations that you give to an ``#atomically`` block are sent to the
database in a single atomic command.

.. TODO is this still true?

.. note::
   Atomic operations apply to one document at a time. Therefore, nested
   ``#atomically`` blocks cannot make changes to multiple documents in one
   atomic operation. To make changes to multiple documents in one atomic
   operation, use a multi-document transaction. To learn more about transactions,
   see :ref:`transactions`.

To use the ``#atomically`` method, call it on a document and pass a block to it.
The following example shows how to use ``#atomically`` to atomically perform an 
``$inc`` and ``$set`` operation:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start atomically example
   :end-before: end atomically example

You can nest ``#atomically`` blocks. By default, {+odm+} performs atomic writes
defined by each block when the block ends. The following example shows how to nest
``#atomically`` blocks:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start default block atomic example
   :end-before: end default block atomic example

In the preceding example, the ``$inc`` and ``$set`` operations are executed at
the end of the inner ``#atomically`` block.

Join Contexts
`````````````
.. TODO: test if it's join_contexts or context

The ``#atomically`` method accepts a ``join_contexts: true`` option to specify that
operations execute at the end of the outermost ``#atomically`` block. When you
enable this option, only the outermost block, or the first block where ``join_contexts``
is ``false``, writes changes to the cluster. The following example sets
the ``join_contexts`` option to ``true``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: start join_contexts atomic
   :end-before: end join_contexts atomic

In the preceding example, the ``$inc`` and ``$set`` operations will be executed at the 
end of the outermost ``#atomically`` block. However, since an exception is raised
before the block ends and these operations can execute, the changes are not
persisted.

You can also enable context joining globally, so that operations execute in the
outermost ``#atomically`` block by default. To do this, set the ``join_contexts``
configuration option to ``true`` in your ``mongoid.yml`` file. To learn more about
{+odm+} configuration options, see :ref:`configuration-options`.

When you globally set ``join_contexts`` to ``true``, you can use the ``join_context: false``
option on an ``#atomically`` block to execute operations at the end of the block.
